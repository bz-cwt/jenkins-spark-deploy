  Optional. If your Spark Masters are behind a load balancer / proxy, you can use this to tell Jenkins which URL
  to use for communicating over REST. Also, if you have HTTPS enabled, you will have to use this option. If this is not
    provided, the Spark Master URL will be used to determine the default (that is spark:// will become http://).
  Example: <i>http://master.spark.cluster.com:6066</i>
