<div>
  Application JAR URL. If the JAR file is in HDFS, this should be the HDFS URL. If it is available over HTTP or HTTPS,
  this should be the relevant URL. File URLs are also supported, but those URLs should be valid within executors for
  that to work. Example: <i>http://some.file.server/spark-app.jar</i>
